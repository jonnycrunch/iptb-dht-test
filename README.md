## Introduction

In the context of creating stress tests for `libp2p-kad-dht`, as well as paving the way to create a test bed for the `libp2p-kad-dht`, this repo was created.

The main focus of these tests are to test two different workloads, which usually are the focus of testing DHTs regarding its scalability. These workloads are **churn intensive** and **lookup intensive**. The first aims to test the network with a high number of peers connecting and disconnecting the network, while data is added to the dht and fetched back. The last one main goal is to have constant `put` and `get` in the network nodes.

## Install

### js-ipfs through CLI

Information can be obtained in [ipfs/js-ipfs/#through-command-line-tool](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/#through-command-line-tool).

### IPTB

Information can be obtained in [ipfs/iptb#install](https://github.com/ipfs/iptb#install)

### IPTB Plugin

Needs to install plugin for using `js-ipfs`. Information can be otained in [ipfs/iptb-plugins](https://github.com/ipfs/iptb-plugins)

## Usage

There are several parameters that can be used with this test:

- network size
- lookup factor
- churn factor

## Experience

The metrics that can be obtained with this test are the following:

- lookup average round trip latency
- success rate
- timeouts

## Results

WIP
